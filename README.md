#### Elevator pitch

Leviathan aims to be to Clojure what Xcode is to ObjC and IntelliJ is to Java.

Some permanent project goals:

- Lightweight and fast
- Minimalist UI
- Favors keyboard shortcuts
- Highly Clojure-specific refactoring functions
- User-customizable refactoring functions
- Completely customizable key bindings

#### Free and Open Source

Leviathan was originally intended to be a commercial IDE. But together, we can make this an even higher quality app.
